DBIx-IO version 1.06
====================

Why yet another database abstraction layer module?
Perhaps the most important advantage/distinction DBIx::IO
has is auto-discovery of the data dictionary.

With auto-discovery there is less code to write/maintain
and your DBA can make structural changes that will be
immediately recognized.

For details start with perldoc DBIx::IO.
